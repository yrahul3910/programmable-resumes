# Template developer documentation

As a template developer, you are expected to publish a template spec file (`spec.py`), along with any auxiliary files your template might need. Typically, this will include a preamble of some sort and a LaTeX class file. You may also include auxiliary files as necessary. You should also include a `README.md` file that describes how to use your template. See the `examples/` directory for two examples.
